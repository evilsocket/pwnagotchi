# Used for bluetooth tethering plugin.
dbus-python~=1.2

# Used for parsing LastSession logs in manual mode.
file-read-backwards~=2.0

# Only using basic Flask and Flask plugin features.
# Should be kept up-to-date as Flask is notorious for breaking
# environments with their extremely loose dependency definitions.
flask-cors~=3.0
flask-wtf~=1.0
flask~=1.0

# Used for modeling AI parameters.
# NOTE: stable-baselines wants gym[atari,classic_control] but we
# can't satisfy the "atari" extra because it requires ale-py
# which has no source distributions or RasPi wheels.
# Using pip's new backtracking resolver from pip>=20.3 is required
# as it improves handling of extras required by indirect dependencies.
# NOTE: gym v0.22 modified the gym.Env API.
gym~=0.14,<0.22

# Used for Inky pHAT and wHAT displays.
inky~=1.2

# Used in the AI and UI layers.
# Only using basic numpy features.
numpy~=1.20

# Used in the UI layer.
# Only using core PIL features (Image, ImageFont, ImageDraw).
# Very stable library, should be safe to upgrade.
Pillow>=5.4

# Used for pwngrid identity verification (PKCS1, RSA, SHA256).
# Very stable library, should be safe to upgrade.
pycryptodome~=3.9

# Used for GPS plugin to parse a GPS datetime string.
python-dateutil~=2.8

# Used exclusively to convert legacy YAML configs to TOML.
PyYAML>=5.3

# Used for HTTP requests with bettercap, pwngrid, and plugins.
# Only using core library features (GET, POST, Sessions).
# Very stable library, should be safe to upgrade.
requests~=2.21

# Used for WiFi pwnage and WiGLE plugin.
scapy~=2.4

# I2C/SPI communication with displays, also used by some plugins.
smbus2~=0.4
spidev~=3.5

# Primary AI library.  Safe to upgrade as v3 is a different package.
# Upgrading to stable-baselines3 is currently impossible because
# it depends on PyTorch which requires a 64-bit processor.
stable-baselines~=2.7

# stable-baselines made a mistake.
# stable-baselines has a tensorflow requirement of ">=1.8.0,<2.0.0",
# but the requirement is the result of a calculation during setup.
# As a result, the requirement is entirely missing from the wheel file.
# Furthermore, "<2.0.0" will fail because tensorflow v1.14 contains
# breaking API changes in preparation for their v2.X release.
tensorflow>=1.8.0,<1.14.0

# Used for loading and writing configs.
toml~=0.10

# Used for communicating with bettercap.
websockets~=8.1

# WARNING: conflict prevention hack!
# flask v1.X requires "Jinja2 >= 2.10, < 3.0"
# Jinja2 v2.X requires "MarkupSafe >= 0.23" for a deprecated
# function that was later removed in MarkupSafe v2.1.0.
# Jinja2 v3.0 no longer uses the deprecated function but
